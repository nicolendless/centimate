# üí∏**Centimate API**üí∏

The **Centimate API** is a Spring Boot-based expense tracker designed to help users manage their financial transactions. It provides secure user authentication with JWT and endpoints for expense management.

---

## **Features**
- User authentication with signup and login.
- Expense tracking with CRUD operations.
- Expense categorization (e.g., GROCERIES, HEALTH, LEISURE).
- Integration with PostgresSQL.
- Dockerized for deployment and management.

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd centimate-api
```

### **2.Configure Environment Variables**
Create a .env file in the project root with the following:
```sh
POSTGRES_DB=centimate_db
POSTGRES_USER=local
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
JWT_SECRET=<your-generated-secret>
```

**Important:**

-   Replace `<your-generated-secret>` with a securely generated key.
-   You can generate a secure key using:

    ```
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```


### **3. Build and Run the Application**
```sh
make build
make run
```

## **API Usage Overview**

To use the Centimate API, follow these steps:

1. **Signup:** Register a new user via `/auth/signup`.
2. **Login:** Obtain an authentication token via `/auth/login`.
3. **Authenticate:** Include the token in your requests as a Bearer Token.
4. **Access Endpoints:** Use the available endpoints to manage expenses.

For detailed API endpoint information, refer to the [API Documentation](./API.md).

---


## **Testing**
Run the following command to execute tests:
```sh
make test
```
---

## **Stopping and Cleaning**
To stop the services:
```sh
make stop
```

To stop and remove all containers, volumes, and networks:
```sh
make clean
```

**Trade-offs**
--------------

‚ùå **Expenses are not user-specific** -- All users can see all expenses.\
‚úÖ **Solution:** Associate expenses with a user so each user only sees their own expenses.

‚ùå **Tests are incomplete and failing** -- The failures are due to a configuration issue, not a logic error.\
‚úÖ **Solution:** Debug the test setup to ensure proper execution.

‚ùå **Users cannot create categories** -- Categories are predefined and cannot be customized.\
‚úÖ **Solution:** Allow users to create and manage their own categories.

‚ùå **No logout endpoint** -- There's no way to invalidate a user's session.\
‚úÖ **Solution:** Add a logout endpoint to properly handle session termination.

‚ùå **Expense DTO includes unnecessary details** -- The DTO returns notes in list views, making responses larger than necessary.\
‚úÖ **Solution:** Use a shorter DTO for lists and include notes only in detailed views.

**Future Improvements**
-----------------------

**Total Spending API** -- Add an endpoint to calculate total spending over a selected period.

**Expense Visualization** -- Implement charts to display spending trends and insights.

**Budgeting Feature** -- Introduce a class to set budget limits, helping users track and manage expenses within predefined limits.
